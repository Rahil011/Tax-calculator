# Tax-calculator
This is a simple web application that calculates tax based on user input. The tax calculation follows specific rules based on the user's age and income.

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone <repository-url>
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd <Directory Name>

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the tax calculator application.

## Usage

1. Enter the gross annual income, extra income, deductions, and select the age group from the dropdown menu.
2. Click on the "Calculate Tax" button to see the tax calculation result.
3. If any input errors occur (e.g., entering text instead of numbers), error icons will appear next to the input fields, indicating the error. Hovering over the error icons will display tooltips with error messages.

## Explanation of Code

The code consists of three main files:

1. `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the tax calculator web application. It includes form elements for user input, error handling, and a modal for displaying the tax calculation result.

2. `styles.css`: Contains the CSS styles to style the HTML elements and make the application visually appealing. It includes styles for centering the content, input fields, error icons, and the modal.

3. `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code to handle user interactions, validate form inputs, calculate tax based on user input, and display the tax calculation result. It listens for events such as form submission and input changes to perform the necessary actions.

## Dependencies

The project has no external dependencies and can be run directly in any modern web browser without additional setup.
